## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
setwd("E:\\Office Account\\2022\\R语言-技术邻近性")
library(readxl)
X <- read_xlsx("tech.xlsx",sheet = 1)
X
Consine=matrix(data=0,nrow =dim(X)[1],ncol = dim(X)[1])
for (i in 1:dim(X)[1])
  for (j in 1:dim(X)[1])
      Consine[i,j] = sum(t(X[i,])*X[j,])/sqrt((sum(X[i,]^2))*sum(X[j,]^2))
Consine
```
